Hello All!

I am a proud fur-mother of five; four cats (Gulliver, Hammie, Bruce, Diglet) and one horse (Thistle). I spend my time working with Thistle, spending time with my twin sister Elizabeth, going up to our cabin in Cable, WI, visiting the North Shore for agate hunting, and am an avid fossil hunter.
