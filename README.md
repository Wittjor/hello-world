Hello All!

There's so much about me, I could write a book. Here's the jist of it: I am a proud fur-mother of five; four cats (Gulliver, Hammie, Bruce, Diglet) and one horse (Thistle). I spend my time working with Thistle, spending time with my twin sister Elizabeth, muskie angling at our cabin in Cable, WI, visiting the North Shore for agate hunting, and am an avid fossil hunter.
